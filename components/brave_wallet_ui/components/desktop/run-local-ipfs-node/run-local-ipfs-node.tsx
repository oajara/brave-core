          <Description>
            Today's centralized internet model doesn't work in space. On todayâ€™s internet, every time you click something, that data has to be retrieved from a centralized server. If you are on the moon, there will be a delay with every click, as content is retrieved from earth. Using IPFS, content is retrieved from wherever is closest. If someone else nearby on the moon has already retrieved that data, your data can be retrieved by you or them on the moon. So is your NFT data.

              Today's centralized internet model doesn't work in space. On todayâ€™s
              internet, every time you click something, that data has to be
              retrieved from a centralized server. If you are on the moon, there
              will be a delay with every click, as content is retrieved from
              earth. Using IPFS, content is retrieved from wherever is closest. If
              someone else nearby on the moon has already retrieved that data,
              your data can be retrieved by you or them on the moon. So is your
              NFT data.
